# Younis Moussavi :school_satchel:

I am a student at ITHS in Gothenburg Sweden from the autumn 2023. I will study AI and machinelearning here for two years, and I am very excited! Since I am a very dedicated and driven person towards the goals I set, I expect myself to work hard toward the goals of the studies.

I hope this will be a start to a GitHub portfolio with interesting projects.
